# AutoFish Modification for www.mcelf.com

The minecraft server of www.mcelf.com(version-1.9.4) add a new rule to anti-autofish, that is to increase the food consume speed when fishing. So the players may be hungery to die if careless.

This modified mod add a new function, when a fishing player is hungery, the player will eat the food on the hotbar automatically.

For some reason, the mod's package is renamed to pass the administration. And part of source code is hidden for the same reason.

Special thanks to FreneticFeline and troyboy50.


## AutoFish Forge Mod by FreneticFeline

AutoFish Forge Mod is a Minecraft mod that provides the option to automatically reel
in and re-cast the fishing rod when a nibble is detected.  Additional options include
MultiRod, which automatically switches to the next available fishing rod in the hotbar
when the current rod breaks; and Break Protection, which will stop using a rod before
it breaks.
