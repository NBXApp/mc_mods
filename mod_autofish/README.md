# AutoFish Modification for www.mcelf.com

本插件是专门针对www.mcelf.com ，该服务器针对钓鱼之风盛行，增加了一条规则来反制autofish，就是增加食物的消耗速度，粗心的玩家甚至会饿死。

新插件主要有如下功能：1、自动钓鱼，2、自动进食，3、防呆（服务器卡比）

The minecraft server of www.mcelf.com (version-1.9.4) add a new rule to anti-autofish mod, that is to increase the food consume speed when fishing. Some players may be hungry to die if careless.

This modified auto-fish mod is come from FreneticFeline's copy. It adds a new auto-eat function, when a fishing player is hungry, the player will eat the food on the hotbar automatically.

For some reason, the mod's package is renamed to avoid the administration. And part of source code is hidden for the same reason.

Special thanks to FreneticFeline and troyboy50.


## AutoFish Forge Mod by FreneticFeline

AutoFish Forge Mod is a Minecraft mod that provides the option to automatically reel
in and re-cast the fishing rod when a nibble is detected.  Additional options include
MultiRod, which automatically switches to the next available fishing rod in the hotbar
when the current rod breaks; and Break Protection, which will stop using a rod before
it breaks.
